Since our work is based on a language model, it is not possible to upload the fine-tuned model. To demonstrate the rationale of our work, we present the log files in the "log" directory.

1. Log files without fine-tuning and pivot model:
   - 4o_output.jsonl 
   - 35_output.jsonl 
   - qwen_output.jsonl 
   - llama_output.jsonl


2. Log file with fine-tuning:
   - qwen_lora_output.jsonl 


3. Log file of our work:
   - dec_output.jsonl


4. Log files of ablation experiment:
   - without_attribution.jsonl
   - without_sft.jsonl
